              <h3>Mission</h3>
              <div class="article-cont">
                <p>We believe that children are learning every minute of the day. They learn from the way we organize the classroom, from the daily schedule, from activities, and when they play outdoors. Play is an essential part of children's learning and general development and we provide lots and lots of it.Our mission is to create an institution where children can learn in a dynamic challenging environment, which fosters in them strong moral values and a passion for learning. We believe that learning is a lifelong process and that every child is unique and special. Every child can be guided at his or her own pace in an environment which demonstrates love and acceptance. We seek a strong foundation for our children. We believe in making Teaching a Joy and Learning a Pleasure. We offer a stimulating combination of academic, artistic and practical activities in a caring environment, where every child gets to learn without being made to feel that he or she is being taught.</p>

                <p>We as educators need to prepare each child for that moment so that he/she can welcome it without hesitation and become a part of it harmoniously. I would like to be part of that team that endeavors to do so.</p>
                <p>Education is my passion. I believe in an education that enables me to discover who I am in my innermost depth, and how best can I use my talents and god given gifts for my own growth and prosperity, thereby becoming an asset to the community and the nation at large.</p>
                <p>Education for Life is what I vouch for. An individual seeks education not only to acquire knowledge which I admit is important for practical life but more importantly education is sought to better one’s life emotionally, socially, economically and last but not the least spiritually.</p>
                <p>We need to make children think on their own, generate loads of questions for it is only when they start to think on their own, that they see clarity and will be able to work on the loop holes that exist in any system which will nudge them to create their own. This is where our challenge lies to create new thinkers, not imitators of the past.</p>
                <p>At the same time I feel a lot of time is being consumed in outside knowledge rather than focusing on the pearl that lies within. Education should be able to cater to individualism for each child is different and each can excel in what they do best.</p>
                <p>Can we allow ourselves as educators to take that bold step of making a difference in giving our children sacred space where they learn to find their own answers, make their own choices , discover their true potential and create their own destiny.</p>
